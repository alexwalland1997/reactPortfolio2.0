          Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander Walland! I'm an aspiring front-end developer
          passionate about creating engaging user experiences. Skilled in HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Huddersfield in 2018 with a 2:2
          BSc(Hons) in computer games programming but upon getting over burnt
          out I realised this wasn't what I wanted to do. Therefore I enrolled
          in a EDX bootcamp in frontend web development in 2003 which I
          completed in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon completing the bootcamp I had a 10 week virtual internship with
          Prime Global where I furthered my frontend skills as well as learnt
          how to use wordpress to further my skillset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you will see a select sample of my projects I have created
          across my academic time as well as my free time along with live links
          to the site as well as my github repository's.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time when I'm not programming I am a avid gamer who's
          always looking at new technology to keep up with any changes as well
          as a massive football fan.
